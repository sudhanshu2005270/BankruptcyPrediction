# BankruptcyPrediction
This repository contains a ML project for bankruptcy prediction model.

This ML project follows the standard flow of Data Loading, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Train test Split & Model Building. 

The model is again improved by reducing the imbalanace present in the target variable using Boderline SMOTE.

After which the number of columns are reduced by using PCA to make the model faster and more compact.

I have also attached a PPT along with the python notebook which also talks about the inferences drawn from the analysis.

If you like this model or if this model is even a slight help to you please share this with others too, let's all learn & grow together.

Happy Learning!
